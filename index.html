fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~gkatz/index.html">Vasilis Gkatzelis</a>. I am interesed in the intersection of Economics and Computer Science, particularly
in algorithmic game theory, mechanism design and fair division.

<p> I received my undergraduate degree from Drexel University, majoring in Mathematics. During my undergraduate years I have worked as assistant product
 manager in <a href:"https://business.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> and Digital Quality Operations Analyst in <a href:"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">J.P.Morgan Chase & Co</a>.
