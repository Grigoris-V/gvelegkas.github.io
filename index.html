         img style="float: left; padding-right: 50px;"> I'm a second-year PhD student in the <a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/computer-science-department/">Computer Science</a> department at Drexel University where I am extremely
fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~gkatz/index.html">Vasilis Gkatzelis</a>. I am interesed in the intersection of Economics and Computer Science, particularly
in algorithmic game theory, mechanism design and fair division.

<p> I received my undergraduate degree from Drexel University, majoring in Mathematics. During my undergraduate years I have worked as assistant product
 manager in Comcast and Digital Quality Operations Analyst in J.P.Morgan Chase & Co.</p>
